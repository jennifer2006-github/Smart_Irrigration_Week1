# 🌱 Smart Irrigation System using Machine Learning

This project is a **Smart Irrigation System** developed using Python and machine learning to predict whether irrigation is needed based on environmental conditions.

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset includes:
- Temperature
- Humidity
- Soil Moisture
- Target label indicating whether irrigation is required

> Ensure your dataset file is named `irrigation_machine.csv` and is placed in the working directory.

## ⚙️ Tools & Libraries Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualizations)
- Google Colab (for development)

## 🧠 Model Used
A classification model such as:
- Decision Tree / Random Forest / Logistic Regression
was used to predict the need for irrigation.

## 🔍 How It Works
1. Load and preprocess the data.
2. Split into train-test sets.
3. Train the classification model.
4. Evaluate using classification report and accuracy score.
5. Predict irrigation requirements for new data.

## 📊 Output
- Accuracy Score
- Classification Report
- Confusion Matrix

## 📁 How to Use
1. Open the Colab notebook.
2. Upload `irrigation_machine.csv`.
3. Run all cells.
4. View predictions and metrics.
