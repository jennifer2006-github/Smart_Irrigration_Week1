🌱 Smart Irrigation System using Machine Learning
This project is a Smart Irrigation System developed using Python and machine learning to predict whether irrigation is needed based on environmental conditions.

📂 Dataset
The dataset includes:

Temperature
Humidity
Soil Moisture
Target label indicating whether irrigation is required
Ensure your dataset file is named irrigation_machine.csv and is placed in the working directory.

⚙️ Tools & Libraries Used
Python
Pandas
NumPy
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualizations)
Google Colab (for development)
🧠 Model Used
A classification model such as:

Decision Tree / Random Forest / Logistic Regression was used to predict the need for irrigation.
🔍 How It Works
Load and preprocess the data.
Split into train-test sets.
Train the classification model.
Evaluate using classification report and accuracy score.
Predict irrigation requirements for new data.
